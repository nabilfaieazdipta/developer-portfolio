            <h2>Let's talk about children</h2>
            <p>Children generally have fewer rights than adults and are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and
                legally must always be under the care of a responsible adult or child custody, whether their parents
                divorce or not. Recognition of childhood as a state different from adulthood began to emerge in the 16th
                and 17th centuries. Society began to relate to the child not as a miniature adult but as a person of a
                lower level of maturity needing adult protection, love and nurturing. This change can be traced in
                paintings: In the Middle Ages, children were portrayed in art as miniature adults with no childlike
                characteristics. In the 16th century, images of children began to acquire a distinct childlike
                appearance. From the late 17th century onwards, children were shown playing with toys and later
                literature for children also began to develop at this time.
